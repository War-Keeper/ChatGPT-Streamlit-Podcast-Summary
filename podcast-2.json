Clockwise for people, for tech topics, 30 minutes. Welcome back to Clockwise, the tech podcast that fears not the Ides of August. Because that was yesterday. I am one of your hosts, Micah Sargent, and I am joined across the internet by my good pal, my dungeon buddy, because we play Dungeons and Dragons online together. It's Dan the Man Morin. How you doing, Dan? Well, I'm glad, Micah, that neither of us got assassinated yesterday. That really would have put a damper on things. So nice try, Ides of August. See you next year. I also learned that Ides is just the middle of the month and I didn't realize it was so unspecial and it makes me kind of sad. But yeah, I guess I will celebrate every Ides every month until the end of time. And another thing that I will celebrate until the end of time is being joined by the person to my left. It is a podcaster, a business unicorn and an occasional dungeon buddy as well. It's Kathy Campbell. Welcome back, Kathy. Hi, Micah Sargent. It seems like my assassins have failed again. You will never get me, Campbell. Boy this got weird. Ah, well, to my left this week, you may have heard him on some podcasts or read some of his excellent writings around automation. It is the Crackerjack shortcut virtuoso himself, Matthew Castanelli. Welcome back, Matt. Excellent. Thank you for having me again. I love the introduction. There we go. Ah, well, you know how this show works for Topics 30 Minutes and let's get underway with my topic. My question for you, many streaming sites and services and apps, they all give you the ability to speed up what you're watching or listening to. And I'd like to know, do you listen to or watch sped up content? Where? Why? How? Etc. Kathy, we'll start with you. No, because I am not a monster, but also I can't understand as much with regular speech. I have to concentrate really hard. So any faster and I would completely be lost. I don't really watch sped up content. I find that super challenging, especially if it's any sort of like a TV show with a narrative TV show. I can't do that. Or a movie? No, never. Please. I mean, these are set to a deliberate pace and I feel like I want to experience them at the speed at which they were intended. Maybe that makes me the weirdo. I don't know, but that's kind of how I feel about that kind of content. I mean, I like you wouldn't. Would you speed up a song? That seems weird, right? You wouldn't steal a car. Referencing knowledge. But like I wouldn't do that with music. I mean, certainly only spoken word. I have done it occasionally on podcasts, but almost always in cases where I need to listen to something in an allotted time. I'm not going to say any specific examples other than occasionally podcasts have sponsored podcasts that I'm on and they like you to listen to an episode. I think to myself, am I going to listen to a whole hour long episode? Ah, but am I going to listen to it at 2X? Yes, I very well do that. There are times where it's expedient certainly to speed up the listening process, but I think overall I generally tend to stick to 1X. Every once in a while I'll go up to 1.25, but after that I feel like everybody starts to sound like chipmunks and I just can't handle it. Matthew, what about you? I used to be all in on SmartSpeed and like 1.75 and then I think I was listening to podcasts all day long and just slamming ideas into my brain constantly. I think after a while I was like, oh, this doesn't work well for me. So I use the podcast app at like 1.25. I think that's a good balance. I don't do YouTube videos or anything like that, but I just now remembered that if you use movies anywhere, you can sync your movies to YouTube and watch them there. So I might watch some excellent cinema in 2X speed. Christopher Nolan wants you to do that. Just to really make Kathy squirm. Oppenheimer's half as long. Listen, you do whatever makes you happy. I'm still stuck on. I'm still stuck on you slamming ideas into your brain and in my head, you're also like pounding red bulls or something. It's slamming them on his forehead. I can see all the electrons in the universe. Yeah, I am the same way, Dan. I don't do that with visual content. The only exception is it's a D&D actual play podcast and it has a visual component, but I'm not watching. I'm just listening most of the time, so I will speed that up. Yeah, I listen to depending on the audiobook because some audiobooks are they have a narrator who speaks nice and quick and then it's fine. I'll leave it at 1X, but you also get the occasional audiobook narrator who does not read very quickly. And so I tend to be at 1.3X on those. If it feels like I'm predicting what is next going to be said, then I'm probably going to go ahead and speed it up. But yes, watching something that does not have that same application for me. All right. Thank you all for your answers on that. Let's move to our next topic, which comes from Kathy. All right. The rumor of Apple buying Disney has picked up speed recently. If Apple does buy Disney and takes over the Disney parks in particular, what is one change you would like made in the parks? So I don't know what the current state of the art is, but I do think that the idea of folding in the technology Apple has to offer would be really cool. I'd love to see some stuff done around location sensitive things, especially because with iPhones having the U1 chip and things like AirTags, I think it would be cool to have experiences that are somehow connected on your smartphone to proximity. And I'm sure some of this stuff is possible today and maybe even there's some of it being done in some of the parks since I have last been. But I do think there's a really cool technology that has been, Apple is talking about more and more with both NFC and the proximity chips that could be used to add other sort of fun games and things that you can do outside of just being around the park itself. So maybe that's some implementation that I'd like to see. I also don't know what the prevalence of something like Apple Pay is. I know they have, like the bands have some sort of chips in them that you can wave and pay for things, but just, you know, but Apple Pay everywhere, obviously. Matthew? So this is a little out of left field for me, but shortcut support, maybe. I think it would be pretty nice to get the same top. It would be pretty nice to get like ride real time information, like how long is this ride and how long does it take to walk over there and with the line and you could like optimize your whole day just with the actual data. So I know it's a wild answer for me, but now I understand what you meant, though. Yes, that's cool. I was going to pretty much go with with Dan's in terms of using the ultra wideband chip stuff to help you find your way around the park or if you know you, you lose your your group if you all sort of were on find my but find my took things even further by allowing for that kind of ultra wideband chip usage to get some very precise location stuff. That would be fantastic. I would also because I have not been to a Disney park since I was six years old. But what I do know is that it continues to be an incredibly expensive investment. So maybe if they, I don't know, made water free and they just made it a little bit more, I don't know, accessible to more folks in terms of the costs that are there if it was owned by such a big company who's like Apple famous. I know. I know. All about lower prices. Yeah. But at the same time, like I don't see Apple being as chill with the idea of people having to pay like seven dollars for a bottle of water or something like that. So I could see them sort of implementing a few. We need to serve their basic needs without charging them more money. But everything else, yes, is expensive. That would be neat. And then I guess what they would also do is, you know, all of the little like the making your lightsaber stuff would get even better. You know, they'd use even better materials for it and it would be even more of a cool investment. So yeah. Why don't you round us out with your perfect Disney park owned by Apple? Well, the first thing to say is that you can actually get free ice water from all of the little stands. You just go up and ask for a cup. It's just a small cup, but you can ask for multiple. So there are these free water in Disney. I would like to see. I love the idea of like more location things, especially like some interactive stuff with the app, possibly like direct linkage between the Disney band, magic band, magic band. That's what it's called. The magic band and the app or like with your phone specifically, like if you could connect your Apple watch to the magic band so you didn't have to have, you know, look like one of the Apple professionals that have the three, four or five watches on their wrist. I can actually do this. What? Yeah, I know. I know you can like detach it from the band and attach it to a watch band, but I didn't know you could do it. Oh, wow. I've just been doing the research before. Excellent. Well, that must be. I'll check in. Yeah. Yeah. Very important. You know, a follow up in clockwise, which doesn't have follow up. I love it. But also maybe like charging stations would be nice. They have the little cell like little refillable charger things that you buy once and you can just swap them out at. Oh, that's little vendor machine things for free. You just swap it out and it's full. But it'd be nice if like it was a fancier one or like, I don't know, some sort of the MagSafe. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Something like that. I don't know. So thank you for your answers. That is an excellent question, Kathy. Thank you for that topic. It is halftime here at clockwise. And that is my opportunity to remind you about the clockwise shirt. I have since purchased a second one because of how soft these shirts are. They're ridiculously soft and ridiculously cool. This is the clockwise tee that you can get at clockwise dot social slash shirt. When you head there, you will see our beautiful clockwise tee in several different colors, blue, green, yellow, red and gray. It has a little clockwise stopwatch on it and you can get it in T form, sweatshirt form, tank form, onesie form. And it's just a chance to represent our show and we would appreciate it if you considered picking one up. I kid you not, I could just like have the shirt next to me and just kind of like run my hand over it and I would be happy because it's such a soft shirt. I don't know what they're doing over there at Cotton Bureau, but they've got it figured out. Cotton Bureau is people that make t-shirts. It's just the people that make the tees. And one of our listeners asked a very good question. How big does the onesie get? Unfortunately, they only have it in infant size, but you know, I might have to reach out to to Cotton Bureau and see if they couldn't get a larger size. I would like an adult size, an adult size onesie, please. Again, that's a clockwise dot social slash shirt. And by that, I mean the T sweatshirt or tank, not the adult sized onesie yet. Let us head back from halftime. It's time for Dan's topic. Well, there is a rumor that Apple might have a more substantive Apple Watch update coming in the next few years, which might include after a decade, a change to how watch bands connect. My question is, do you have a lot of watch bands? You use a lot of watch bands. Do you find yourself switching and would this meaningfully affect your decision of whether or not to get a new Apple Watch? Matthew, let's start with you. I'm not sure if I would if this would prevent me from getting a new watch. I actually end up mostly using one or two bands. I think for a while I was trying to like get a bunch of styles, but I wasn't very good at matching them with what I was wearing and things like that. And just kind of always ended up using black. I've actually used the bright yellow ocean band since I got the Apple Watch Ultra, though, and I feel like it's become part of my personality. So I'm curious just like what what difference they could make. I would like some like smart bands or something if that's where they're going. But that could maybe make me upgrade. But I'm not sure. I don't have like so many that I'd like wait for the upgrade just because of the watch band. I also have a lot of watch bands and I don't use them when I upgraded to the ultra. I have the oh goodness, it's not the ocean band and it's not the hiking band. It's the other one. And it is quite lovely. It's got a hook and it's green and it has these little like a strappy loop thing going. And it's such a great band for the ultra that I have not really wanted to change out the only thing is during the week I will change into one of the Flormel on the last monster bands when I'm working out. But when outside of that, like I just wear this green one everywhere because it's green, first of all, but because it's kind of it can work, I think in any style and because I find that a lot of the bands that I have up to this point don't quite offer the support for the ultra that I'd like the wrist support. They kind of seem a little thin. So yeah, I don't know if the magnetic option would mean that like if it makes it easier to switch between bands, if that would make me more interested in switching them regularly because I just don't find myself wanting to once I've got the band that I really like, I tend to stick with it. So yeah, that's that's where I am with my Apple watch and with bands. Kathy, what about you? I have about 15. And I haven't really changed since the 2019 Nike Pride band, except I do have bands for my local dance team and the dance studio that I take photos for. And so I'll swap that out for the day. But other than that, I am all in on the white rainbow Nike whole band. I did just upgrade. So I went from series five to series eight last year. And I'll probably be sticking with this until it dies again. My wrist is not made for the ultra. So definitely and if I'm hiking, I've probably crashed in the forest airplane. So like, you won't see me hiking necessarily. So I think I'll stick with this for a while. So we'll see what happens in the next four years or so to watches maybe. Yeah, these are all good. I mean, I think watch bands are very personal. And so everybody has kind of a different approach on it. For me, I have not invested a ton in watch bands. I have a couple different ones, but I end up just sort of wearing usually whatever is the newest one I've acquired. And oftentimes that's the one that came with my most recent watch. Like for now, for example, I have a series seven that's a little over a year old and sounded slightly spooky. Seven. And it came with because it's a blue watch, it came with a band that has blue lugs that connect to it. And I kind of like the look of that. So it's like a blue orange sport band that connects with blue lugs. So it doesn't stand out and look weird when I have like different colors in there. So I'm very happy with that one. I've been wearing it pretty exclusively, even though I have maybe four or five other bands that I've had over the last decade. I'd be sad if they switched to something else. But at the same time, I feel like 10 years is a pretty good run. It's about as long as charging cable ports on the iPhone. So you know, nothing stays the same forever. And I think if you can get a decade out of it, that's pretty solid. And I'd be OK swapping over, especially if they had some attractive new band options for me. So I don't think it's going to keep me from buying a new Apple watch, even though I know there will be much griping. But thank you all for your thoughts on that. Let's go to our final topic, which comes from Matthew. So coming in iOS 17 shortcuts is getting updated. So automations are automatic. They have a new run immediately toggle, which is awesome. They've had different versions of this over the years, but it never worked for locations. And so now that is going to work. Things like before and after your commute can be automated. When you receive an email or a message, that's a huge one. And even Bluetooth devices. So my question is, is there anything you would want to automate that you haven't been able to or if not, what's still missing? So you said this is an iOS 17. Do you know if any of this is on Mac OS as well? Not yet. And that's definitely the major hangout or holdout. Yeah, because that's I think that's what I want to have Bluetooth knowledge on Mac OS that I can then have the automations tied to it. Basically when I'm at work, what I do now is I move my cursor to the bottom left corner of the screen when I want to like walk away and go do things. And that locks my Mac because I've got a hot corner turned on. But what would be cool is if there was and people please don't email me. I know that there are applications that try to do this, but they don't do it well. I've tried them. They're not good. I'd love it if there was a proximity sort of awareness that I could use that would allow me to just if you are no longer within Bluetooth range because you happen to have maybe your Apple Watch with you or your AirPods, then go ahead and lock the screen for your Mac. I think that would be quite nice. And I don't really need that on the iPhone as much. But Mac OS is where I'd like to have it. But I also want to quickly celebrate the introduction of these location based automations because it is one of the most common questions we get on iOS today of people wanting to tie their shortcuts to locations and have it happen automatically. So this is fantastic. Kathy, what about you? I don't really have anything that is missing because I don't really use automations. So I don't know. Dan, what about you? Is there anything you want to automate, Kathy? Is there anything in your life that you're like, oh, God, I hate I have to do this all the time? Yeah, make dinner. But shortcuts isn't good. There you go. Shortcuts isn't good. I bet Matt has a way for you to automate making dinner. Every day at five o'clock, just reorder something from Yelp. Yeah, that's not quite. Not affordable, but you can do it. Definitely not budgetary friendly. So yeah, I can't, honestly, I could not think of anything, which is when I saw that Matthew Cazzanelli was on clockwise, I almost said, I'm sorry, Micah, I can't do this because I know it would be a shortcuts question and I am a terrible conversationalist when it comes to automatic things because I don't look. It is a brave thing and a rare thing on this show for someone to be honest and just say, I don't have an answer for that. That doesn't happen very often. And I think that it's good because sometimes some folks just respond and they're saying things that aren't actually adding up to anything. So I appreciate when someone says, you know what? This one's just not for me. I don't need you throwing shade at me, Mike. I was throwing shade at myself a little bit. I will say I was just poking around because I hadn't played much with automation in the beta. And I noticed that one of the available triggers, I don't know if this has been there for a while, Matthew, you can tell me is there's one that fires now when you tap your Apple wallet payment. Yeah, that's the new one. That's cool. So for example, I'm very excited about that because I have a business card that I use when I'm traveling for work. And the idea that I could have it every time I tap it, maybe I could have it figure out the log that I've just paid for something or prompt me to log that I paid for something for work. So I can immediately file that instead of going through all my receipts at the end of the weekend being like, okay, where did I eat? What day was it? When was I doing? That's super cool to me. That is definitely something that I will be looking into and trying to figure out. I agree largely with Micah that there are a lot of automations I'd love to have on the Mac and I am constantly shocked that the Mac, a device that has had automation for a super long time, still does not have shortcuts automation on it. That seems super weird. The ones that appeal to me the most though, I think I struggle with automation sometimes because my needs tend to be variable. Like there's things that would be cool, but I don't necessarily want to run automatically every time because for example, like, Oh, it'd be cool if like, you know, when I get home at night, the news comes on right in my home pod in my kitchen so I can get like started cooking dinner. But like there's definitely, I know there's definitely times I don't want to do that. So like, I still want that control. So I know that that's still an option. But I just, that is where I struggle with. And I totally hear you, Kathy. Sometimes I feel like, well, I could automate this, but I don't want to do it like a hundred percent of the time. And it's coming to groups with reality that like sometimes even something I want done like 75% of the time is might be valuable to have something like that. So yeah, there's a ton of new options here. I'm very excited for the stuff that runs automatically though, because my current automations, I definitely had somewhere like would prompt me. You sure you want to do this? It's like, well, if you're going to ask me every single time, then what's the point? Like the whole point is you're supposed to make this easier for me. I don't need you to ask me. I'm delegating that authority to you. Go on. Anyways, that's where I'm at. My trap is up here. Totally. Especially automations, just they were released and had so many limitations that I feel like now is like the very beginning of even thinking about how to use these because they really couldn't do what you wanted before. Yeah. Those new transaction automations are pretty, pretty powerful, especially for expense reporting. I will say automations in general aren't shareable. So it is pretty hard to share ideas and have it so someone else can actually go and set it up. That is one thing that would make it easier for people who don't have any ideas around automation. If people like me could just make a bunch of them and you could get them. So I think that's a major thing that they need to add. I'm super interested in some of the stuff of like location stuff. The before and after I commute one is super fascinating. I do work from home, so that isn't like perfect for me right now. But if like when it actually does like 15 minutes before I leave every day, there's new actions to use like the intercom on the home pod. So I was imagining that like it could literally be like, hey, it's time to leave. It's pretty busy today. You might want to leave early and things like that. So we're getting into some of those deeper realms of automation, but I do think it's immediately, it's like the thing where now we have a toolbox in a bunch of tools, but I don't have any instructions on what to build. And so it is kind of a reset for automations because now they're actually automatic. Well folks, with that, we have just about reached the end of this episode of clockwise. But I do have a bonus topic for you. Tell us about one of the best gifts you've ever received. Kathy, we'll start with you. I have to say the cabbage patch doll that I got, I think I was seven. I was super excited because it also came with the horse. So it was cowboy cabbage patch and the horse had the saddle and stuff. And then in the next year or two, I got another horse that had like the fancy mane and tail that you could like style and curl and stuff. And that was just like perfection. When I was 21, I was a senior in college, I think I got for Christmas a totally unexpected gift, which is something I had coveted, but not even mentioned to my parents like, oh, I'd like this as a Christmas gift because it seems so outrageously expensive that I did not think there was any chance that I would ever get it. So I had no preconceived notions whatsoever, but it was the original iPod. I got an original iPod from my folks and I love that thing so much. And I was blown away. It was one of the few times I have been like blown away by a present. Mine is going to be a set of lamps that I got when I was 18. For Christmas, just before college. And I remember opening the box and being like, oh, thanks. Like what? I just didn't expect it as a present. I've used them for the last, I'm just now realizing it's 15 years. So that's, I'm having an existential crisis, but there's great lamps. Thank you, mom. It was an excellent, I never thought I needed it. I definitely didn't want to buy them myself. So I love lamp. Mine is going to be, it was a Christmas present that I was, I had asked for, but it was one of those you asked for and you're kind of like, yeah, right. It was the Kindle keyboard. I think it was the second generation of the Kindle with a keyboard. And I remember reading about it and it had the, at the time that built in cellular connectivity that was just free if you purchased the device. But it had the keyboard on it so you could take little notes. And of course it was an E Ink display, which at the time I just thought, oh, that's so cool. And they had us all opening our gifts. And my mom always did the thing where you, there's like the one or two special gifts that you don't open until last. So we're all opening our gifts or whatever. And then this gift comes over to me and it's in the, in a box. It's like a clothing box. And so I opened it up and inside is that I've just was shocked. And I think I spent like the next, just all the rest of the day, just getting it all set up and exactly how I wanted it. And to this day, I still keep it and I still love it. I think it's just such a fantastic little device. Thank you all for your answers on that.
